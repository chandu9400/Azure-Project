<h1><center><b>PROJECT OVERVIEW</b></center></h1>
<br>
<div class="written">
<p>The core idea of this project is <i>"to make light-weighted sensors available to bowlers and accessible by higher authorities to assess the scenario in real time"</i>. Cloud computing using Azure will help in monitoring the bowler’s action remotely during the gameplay and provide accurate results to eradicate chucking.

Furthermore, the appearance of this
strategy guarantees irrelevant square for the player in
finishing his average bowling activity. Moreover, the
effortlessness, and thusly progressively wide reach, is
required to help in early zone of hurling in youthful rising
bowlers, who by then have an unparalleled shot in revising
their bowling development too.
<br>
The band will consist of sensors which will be based on AI. The data associated with bowler’s information and his/her wrist movement, arm flex, speed, release angle etc will be provided to storage resource, known as Azure Cosmos DB. Then, with Azure Functions service, we can host a single method or a function by using a programming language, that respond to database changes, process IoT streams, manage message queues, and more. 
Finally, these sensors will be monitored by IoT Central. It is an IoT application platform that reduces the burden and cost of developing, managing IoT solutions. The web UI created lets you quickly connect devices, monitor device conditions, create rules, and manage data securely. Moreover, any kind of unexpected activity done with the device will be taken care of using triggers in Azure functions.
<br>
<u>Next, I have provided detailed description of how the Azure services are useful in tackling with this scenario.</u></p>
